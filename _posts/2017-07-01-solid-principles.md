title: "SOLID (object-oriented design)"
---
The term SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more **understandable**, **flexible** and **maintainable**. The principles are a subset of many principles promoted by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

## What does SOLID stands for:

| SRP |	The Single Responsibility Principle | 	A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. |
| OCP |	The Open Closed Principle | 	You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.|
| LSP | The Liskov Substitution Principle |	Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.|
| ISP |	The Interface Segregation Principle | 	Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.|
| DIP |	The Dependency Inversion Principle | 	Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.|
